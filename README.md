# Tools-used
- React JS
- vite
- js-cookie
- netlify

# Reasons
- Vite has many advantages over CRA like faster development server startup, reduced waiting times for file updates, and improved build performance.
- Netlify offers quick and fast deployment with minimal setup

# Approach
-The first part of the application development is to be able to develop the add, update and delete operations on the tasks, and the same was my first step to begin the development process
-Once the first task was complete the second task to add the drag and drop feature was approached by me.
